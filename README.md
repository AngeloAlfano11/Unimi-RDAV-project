# Unimi-RDAV-project
Unimi project of a CNN for RDAV (Recognition of Drugs that Affect Vision)

This simple CNN aims to raise awareness about the dangers of driving under the influence of drugs.  
This repository contains all the necessary files to train the neural network and create a dataset with 3 classes, corresponding to Alcohol, Cannabis, and LSD, which are explored in detail in the accompanying PDF presentation.  
The flat image dataset was downloaded from a different project (https://datasetninja.com/road-vehicle).
