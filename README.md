** Unimi project of a CNN for RDAV (Recognition of Drugs that Affect Vision)

This project utilizes a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to raise awareness about the dangers of driving under the influence of drugs. The repository includes all necessary files to train the neural network and create a dataset with three classes: Alcohol, Cannabis, and LSD. These substances are explored in detail in the accompanying PDF presentation.

The flat image dataset used for this project was sourced from [Dataset Ninja's Road Vehicle project](https://datasetninja.com/road-vehicle).
